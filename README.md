# HerFitness_Ai
HerFitness AI is an AI-native nutrition planning system designed specifically for gym-going women, built entirely using Jaclang. The project focuses on providing personalized, goal-oriented nutrition guidance without relying on deep learning models.

Instead of complex neural networks, HerFitness AI uses semantic reasoning, structured objects, and rule-based intelligence, making it lightweight, explainable, and practical for real-world use—especially in low-resource settings.
